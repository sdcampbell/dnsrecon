# Background and Purpose

This isn't your typical subdomain enumeration tool. This tool enriches domain lists by resolving each domain to its IP address and identifying the organization that owns the IP block. This helps you determine which domains are actually in scope for your pentest by showing the real infrastructure owners.

The tool reads domains from stdin (pipe input), resolves each to an IPv4 address, then performs whois lookups to identify the organization that owns each IP block. It supports multiple regional internet registries (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, etc.) and handles rate limiting gracefully.

This is perfect for processing output from subdomain enumeration tools like chaos, subfinder, or amass to add context about which domains are owned by your target organization vs third-party providers.

# Setup

## Install dnsrecon (Go version - Recommended):

```bash
go install github.com/sdcampbell/dnsrecon@latest
```

## Install the Chaos client:

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-client/cmd/chaos@latest
```

## Set the Chaos client API key:

Signup to get your API key here: https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/docs/quick-start

Set the key in your .bashrc or .zshrc file:

```bash
export CHAOS_KEY=<your API key here>
```

# Execution

The tool reads domains from stdin and outputs semicolon-separated results:

```bash
# Using with chaos client
chaos -d example.com | dnsrecon

# Using with file input
cat domains.txt | dnsrecon

# Using with subfinder
subfinder -d example.com | dnsrecon

# Using with amass
amass enum -d example.com | dnsrecon
```

Check version:
```bash
dnsrecon -version
```

There are no banners or progress bars. The output is semi-colon separated for easy parsing with awk/grep/cut/Excel.
